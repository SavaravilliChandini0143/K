<p>KFC (also commonly referred to by its historical name Kentucky Fried Chicken) was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential of restaurant franchising, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Salt Lake County, Utah, in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. Branding himself "Colonel Sanders", the founder became a prominent figure of American cultural history, and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising. The company's rapid expansion made it too large for Sanders to manage, so in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey.</p>


<p>KFC was one of the first fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Britain, Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, KFC experienced mixed success domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R. J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate, which later sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China.</p>

<p>In 1997, PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which changed its name to Yum! Brands in 2002. Yum! has proven to be a more focused owner than Pepsi, and although KFC's number of outlets has declined in the US, the company has continued to grow in Asia, South America, and Africa. The chain has expanded to 18,875 outlets across 118 countries and territories, with 4,563 outlets in China alone, KFC's largest market.</p>

<h1 id="4">About</h1>
<P>Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, is a renowned American fast-food restaurant chain specializing in fried chicken. Established by Colonel Harland Sanders, KFC has evolved from a single roadside establishment to a global presence with over 30,000 locations in 150 countries as of April 2024. 

In 1930, at the age of 40, Harland Sanders purchased a service station in Corbin, Kentucky, where he began serving meals to travelers. By 1936, his establishment had expanded to include a motel and a larger dining area. During this period, Sanders developed his distinctive "Original Recipe" of 11 herbs and spices, which remains a closely guarded secret. 
KFC

Recognizing the potential of franchising, Sanders partnered with Pete Harman of South Salt Lake, Utah, to open the first KFC franchise in 1952. Harman played a pivotal role in branding, coining the term "Kentucky Fried Chicken" and introducing the iconic slogan "It's finger lickin' good." 

The 1950s and 1960s witnessed rapid expansion, with KFC outlets sprouting across the United States and internationally. The brand's entry into international markets began with Canada, followed by the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Jamaica. In 1987, KFC became the first Western fast-food chain to establish a presence in China, a market that has since become its largest. 

Over the decades, KFC underwent several ownership changes. In 1964, Sanders sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for $2 million. Subsequent owners included Heublein, R.J. Reynolds, and PepsiCo. In 1997, PepsiCo spun off its restaurant division, renaming it Yum! Brands, which now oversees KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. 

KFC's menu has diversified over the years to cater to changing consumer preferences. Beyond its signature fried chicken, offerings include chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads, desserts, and beverages. In March 2025, KFC introduced Mashed Potato Poppers in the U.S., inspired by a popular Australian snack. These crispy, fried mashed potato bites are seasoned with KFC's original blend and served with gravy. 

In 2025, KFC announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Louisville, Kentucky, to Plano, Texas, aiming to foster closer collaboration with fellow Yum! Brands subsidiary, Pizza Hut. 

 The company continues to innovate, introducing new meal concepts and enhancing customer experiences through technological upgrades like self-order kiosks and improved kitchen operations.

Colonel Harland Sanders remains an enduring figure in American culture. His image continues to feature prominently in KFC's advertising, embodying the brand's legacy and commitment to quality. The chain's global reach and consistent branding have solidified its status as a household name, influencing fast-food culture worldwide.</P>
